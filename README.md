Page cache plugin by Hametuha. Use cloudflare for distribution.

## Description

[CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) is a popular CDN service. They caches static files like `.jpg`, `.css` or `.html`, but they doesn't cache dynamic pages generated by WordPress without [Page Rule](https://www.cloudflare.com/features-page-rules/must-use-page-rules/).

Once Page Rules are set, for exmple, `https://examle.com/article/*`, every single page will be cached(of course, your permalink structure should be like `https://example.com/article/2019/01/01/POST_ID`).

This plugin **hamecache** provides cache control feature. If you update your article, hamecache automatically flush related caches  on cloudflare edge location.

## Installation

1. Upload `hamecache` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to 'Setting > Cache Setting' and enter your email address and API key which you can get your profile page on [cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
1. Select URL to be purged. Post type, top page, extra pages, and so on.
